# Weather api project

Project is written with Vue3 composition API, Vite and TailwindCSS. I used 2 apis: openWeather for weather info and Mapbox(https://www.mapbox.com/) for autocompleting city names. I also used a npm package for the autocomplete.

Project is setup with:
- npm install
- npm run dev
